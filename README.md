### Hi visitor [<img src="https://profile-counter.glitch.me/Andrew-J-Larson-Alt/count.svg" height="15" alt="Visitor Count">](#) of the day! [<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" height="18" alt="Wave">](#)

This is an alt account to store the archived projects of mine, that I deem have no use, either because of one or many of the reasons below:
- Proof of concepts, never meant to be permanent
- Defunct services, making my code obsolete (because of dead websites/api endpoints, or website replicated the same feature that my code was for)
- Modded projects, usually primarily containg large sums of code that I didn't write (e.g. Minecraft Classic website javascript modding)
